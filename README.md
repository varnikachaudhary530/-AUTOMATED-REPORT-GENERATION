## Task Description:

The second task of my CODTECH internship was to develop a Python script that automates the generation of reports. The idea was to read data from a file (in this case, a CSV file), perform some basic analysis on it, and then generate a clean and formatted PDF report using Python libraries such as pandas for data analysis and fpdf for PDF creation. This task aimed to test how well I could handle data processing and automate documentation — a very common and useful application in real-world data workflows.

 What I Did:

To begin, I chose a simple dataset for demonstration — a CSV file named student_marks.csv. This file contains fictional student records, including names, the subject ("Math"), and the marks they scored.

I started by reading this file using the pandas library, which is a powerful tool for data handling in Python. I used pandas to calculate basic statistics such as:

Total number of students

Average marks

Highest marks along with the name of the top scorer

Lowest marks along with the name of the weakest student


Once this data was computed, I used fpdf, a Python library that allows us to create PDF files programmatically, to generate a well-formatted PDF report. The report includes a header, a timestamp, summary statistics, and a complete data table listing each student’s name, subject, and marks. I made sure the layout was clear, readable, and simple.

 Files Included:

task2.py – The main Python script that performs the analysis and generates the PDF.

student_marks.csv – The input file used for analysis, containing mock student marks data.

Student_Marks_Report.pdf – The final output report automatically generated by the script.

 Resources Used:

Although I already had a basic understanding of Python, I used various internet resources to make sure I implemented everything correctly. I referred to:

Articles and documentation from GeeksForGeeks

Sample code and syntax checks from QuickRef.ME

YouTube tutorials explaining how to use fpdf and pandas effectively

ChatGPT for step-by-step debugging, explanations, and code generation help


I didn’t directly copy-paste any large code blocks but used these platforms to understand the concepts better, debug issues when I got stuck, and ensure that I followed best practices while writing and structuring the code.

 Challenges I Faced:

One of the biggest issues I faced was working with virtual environments and installing external libraries in PyCharm. I also ran into small but tricky bugs, like typing mistakes (idxmaxx instead of idxmax) or trying to load a CSV file that was either empty or wrongly formatted. These were frustrating at first, but they helped me become more confident in reading Python errors and solving them on my own.


---

 Conclusion:

This task helped me understand the practical use of Python in data handling and automation. Creating a report that doesn't require manual typing, formatting, or copying is a powerful tool in any work or study environment. I feel more confident now using Python for real-world tasks and look forward to applying these skills in future projects. Completing this task also improved my debugging skills and taught me the value of clean, readable code.
